# Multivariate-Analysis-Final-Project
My final project for Stat 456, which was a multivariate analysis on QB play during the 2018 season (coded in R)

Analyses included in the project are:

-Graphical analysis/visualizations

-Principal component analysis

-Multidimensional scaling

-Cluster analysis

The Rcode for the final project can be found in Project.rmd, and the report which does not include the rcode can be found in the Final Project pdf
